# Database model design

why this matter 
  - Good design should reduce duplication, prevent anomalies and  makes quries simpler and faster
  - you should be able to justify each table and column

Apprach:
    1. write user questions and access patters
    2. Indentify entities and relationships
    3. For each entity, define your columns and constraints
    4.  Normalize to at least 3 level of Normalization form
    5. Validate with real queries
    6. add indexes for the quries you run often
